# Compensation Philosophy

Our goal is to **pay market-leading total compensation** to attract and retain top talent.

## Principles

1. Pay for impact, not tenure.
2. Use 75th percentile of market data for base salary.
3. Equity grants sized by level and performance.

## Review Cycle

- Annual comp review each April.
- Off-cycle adjustments for promotions or market shifts.
